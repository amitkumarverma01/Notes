### What is Aure Devops-
- Azure DevOps helps teams plan, develop, test, deliver, and monitor software applications. It is designed to support the DevOps lifecycle, which focuses on collaboration between software development and IT operations teams to deliver high-quality software faster.

### Key Features of Azure DevOps:
- Azure DevOps provides a suite of tools for managing the software development lifecycle, including:

    - Azure Repos: Git repositories for source control. It allows teams to manage code in a central repository using Git or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).

    - Azure Pipelines: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline service. It helps automate the build, test, and deployment processes, allowing teams to deploy applications to various environments automatically.

    - Azure Boards: An agile project management tool that allows you to plan, track, and discuss work across teams. It supports Kanban boards, Scrum boards, and backlogs for project management.

    - Azure Test Plans: A set of tools for managing manual tests, creating test plans, and tracking test results.

    - Azure Artifacts: A tool for hosting, managing, and sharing packages, such as NuGet, npm, Maven, and Python packages. It helps in managing dependencies and versioning for your projects.

    - Azure DevOps Services: Cloud-based services that enable DevOps practices for software development, including agile project management, version control, and automated testing.
